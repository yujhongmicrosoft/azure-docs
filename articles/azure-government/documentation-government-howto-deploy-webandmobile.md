# Deploy to Azure App Services using Visual Studio 2015
This article describes how to deploy an Azure App Services app (API App, Web App, Mobile App) to Azure Government using Visual Studio 2015.

## Prerequisites
* See [Visual Studio prerequisites] (../app-service-api/app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md#prerequisites) to install and configure Visual Studio 2015 and Azure SDK.
* Follow [these instructions] (documentation-government-get-started-connect-with-vs.md) to configure Visual Studio to connect to Azure Government account.

## Open App project in Visual Studio
* Open existing app solution\project in Visual Studio, create a project by following [these instructions] (../app-service-web/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md), or download sample app by following [these steps] (../app-service-api/app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md#download-the-sample-application).
* Run the app in Visual Studio to make sure it works locally.

## Deploy to Azure Government
* Once **Visual Studio is configured to connect to Azure Government account** (already done in prerequisites section), instructions to deploy to app services are exactly same as for Azure Public.
* To deploy the app, follow [these steps] (../app-service-api/app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md#createapiapp).
* If the app has been successfully deployed to Azure Government the url as shown in the screenshot should end with "azurewebsites.us".
